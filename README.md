By the way if you like the code and want better hosting than you have atm use code DROPSUIT at my hosting https://hrznhosting.com/

Big thanks to bully hunter for optimizing my poo poo code!
Big thanks to [Hayden](https://github.com/hayden1321) for adding the new Nicer HUD text to my poo poo code!

(Please bear in mind that I am bad at gmod development and a lot of this is prob done using bad practises. But it does work.)

This is the custom code that adds the /dropsuit command to this gmodstore addon addon
https://gmodstore.com/market/view/armor-suits-now-with-saving-options

Installation:

1) Download the "dropsuit.lua" and put it in the "/lua/autorun" folder e.g. /armor_6/lua/autorun/dropsuit.lua

3) Edit the config at the top of the "dropsuit.lua" file to choose whether or not you want a drop delay and a command cooldown, how long the cooldown and delay should be and the messages that are sent in chat.

4) (Optional) You can also replace the "sh_load_armor.lua" in the autorun folder to make the text on the crate model look nicer and to prevent it from making them purchaseable in the f4 menu.

5) (Optional) You can also replace the "cl_armor.lua" in the armor folder to make the text on the HUD look nicer and allow for the tags `Color = Color(0,0,0)`, and `OutlineColor(0,0,0)`, in the /armor/config_armor.lua file.
