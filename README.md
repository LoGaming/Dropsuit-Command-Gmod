# Dropsuit Command + Nicer Crate Text

By the way if you like the code and want better hosting than you have atm use code DROPSUIT at my hosting https://hrznhosting.com/

Big thanks to bully hunter for optimizing my poo poo code!

(Please bear in mind that I am bad at gmod development and a lot of this is done using unoptimised practises. But it does work.)

This is the custom code that adds the /dropsuit command to this gmodstore addon addon
https://gmodstore.com/market/view/armor-suits-now-with-saving-options

Installation:

1) Download the "dropsuit.lua" and put it in the "/lua/autorun" folder e.g. /armor_6/lua/autorun/dropsuit.lua

2) Edit the config at the top of the "dropsuit.lua" file to choose whether or not you want a drop delay and a command cooldown, how long the cooldown and delay should be and the messages that are sent in chat.

3) (Optional) You can also replace the "sh_load_armor.lua" in the autorun folder to make the text on the crate model look nicer and to prevent it from making them purchaseable in the f4 menu.
